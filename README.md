# Customer Churn Prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a business by identifying key factors that contribute to customer attrition.
By leveraging historical customer data, the model helps in pinpointing customers likely to churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them.

# Key Features
- Churn Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of a customer churning based on multiple features.
- Flask Web Application: Provides an intuitive interface to input customer data and view churn predictions.
- Interactive Interface: Simple and user-friendly, designed for quick customer churn analysis.

# Project Structure
- app.py: Main Flask application script to serve the model and web interface.
- churn_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with model training code.
- Churnanalysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- model.sav: Pre-trained model saved as a serialized file.
- templates/: Folder containing HTML templates for the Flask application.
- Images/: Images of website
- error.log: Log file to capture any errors from running the application.
# Data files:
first_tel.csv and tel_churn.csv: Datasets used for training and analysis.

# Results and Analysis
Results of the model and data insights are documented in the Churnanalysis.ipynb and churn_model.ipynb notebooks. 
Key findings include patterns of high-risk churn groups and significant factors affecting customer retention.
